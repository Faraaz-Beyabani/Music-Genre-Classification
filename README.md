# Music-Genre-Classification

This goal of this project was to try and use deep-learning techniques in order to classify various audio snippets by their genre. To that end, we first attempted to classify songs without alteration, then switched the foreground and background audio of two tracks to create a "cross-mix". The learner was built using Keras & Tensorflow, and a secondary classifier of a primitive decision tree was used for an objective measure of accuracy.

The website can be visited at https://faraaz-beyabani.github.io/EECS352-Website/. It contains further detailed descriptions of our work, contact information, statistics, and a few hand-picked cross-mixes.
* Warning: Some of the audio used on the site contains explicit language.
